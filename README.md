This is a coding challenge I completed for a position as React(Next.js) Developer at Renewable Exchange.

The Challenge :

1. Build a user table

- with 5 columns ( Name, email, company, date added, delete button)
- Make rows sortable by column
- Add delete user button to each row

2. Build a addUser dialogue for adding users.

3. Build a user counter that shows the number of current users.

Things I used:

Typescript
React
Next.js
Material-UI
React-hook-form-mui

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
